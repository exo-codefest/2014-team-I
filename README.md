# Introduction

Getting the idea from the whiteboard where we have the scrum meeting in front of it every morning of working days, we created the D2 Addon. In it, we can add a new task presented as a colorful sticker, then easy to drag and drop them to corresponding states (In Progress, Done, Cancelled) to play with it.

# Scope

This addon is designed to be compatible with eXo Platform 4.1.
